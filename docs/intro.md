## Features

* **Multi-user collaboration**: Work simultaneously with team members on the same diagram with real-time updates,
  comments, and version control.

* **Text to diagram conversion**: Automatically generate diagrams from text descriptions and convert existing diagrams
  back to structured text for documentation and accessibility.

* **Advanced layer management**: Organize your diagrams with multiple layers, including specialized rule layers. Layers
  can be locked, hidden, or grouped for precise control over complex diagrams.

* **Nested tabs**: Structure complex projects with hierarchical tabs, allowing you to organize related diagrams together
  while maintaining a clean workspace.

* **Import from Drawio**: Import existing diagrams from Drawio, preserving layouts, styles, and connections.

* **Extensive alignment and snapping capabilities**: Create aligned diagrams with intelligent snapping to
  grids, and other elements.

* **Integrated data management**: Connect your diagrams to data sources, enabling dynamic updates and interactive
  elements. Create data-driven visualizations that automatically reflect changes in your underlying data.

* **Rich visual effects**: Apply effects such as reflections, glass surfaces, and hand-drawn styles to
  create visually appealing and distinctive diagrams.

* **Boolean operations**: Combine shapes using union, intersection, difference, and other boolean operations to create
  complex custom shapes with precision.

* **Comments and review system**: Add comments, feedback, and review notes directly to diagrams, facilitating team
  collaboration and iterative design processes.
