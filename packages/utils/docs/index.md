The `@diagram-craft/utils` package provides a collection of utility
functions and data structures that are generic and not immediately
tied to Diagram Craft's specific use cases.

The utilities span a wide range of functionality including array manipulation
(sorting, grouping, deduplication), object operations (deep merging, cloning,
property path access), string processing, mathematical operations, and type
assertions. It also includes data structures such as priority queues, multimaps,
and graph algorithms for pathfinding and traversal.

Additional capabilities include event handling, debouncing and memoization,
HTML/XML parsing, template processing, watchable values for reactive programming
patterns, and various DOM manipulation helpers.
