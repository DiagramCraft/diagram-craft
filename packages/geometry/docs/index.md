The `@diagram-craft/geometry` package provides geometric
primitives and operations for 2D graphics and diagram manipulation.

The package includes fundamental types such as points, vectors, boxes, and ranges,
along with operations for working with these types. It provides support for geometric
transformations (translation, rotation, scaling), line and Bezier curves.
