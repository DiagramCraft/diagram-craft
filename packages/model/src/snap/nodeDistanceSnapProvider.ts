/**
 * Snap provider for equal distance alignment between nodes
 *
 * This provider creates "distance magnets" that allow elements to snap to positions
 * that maintain equal spacing between existing nodes. For example, if there are two
 * nodes with a 50px gap between them, this provider creates magnets that allow a
 * third node to snap to positions that create another 50px gap.
 *
 * Key concepts:
 * - Finds pairs of existing nodes in each direction (north, south, east, west)
 * - Calculates distances between node pairs that have overlapping ranges
 * - Creates magnetic lines where new elements can snap to maintain equal distances
 * - Only considers nodes that don't intersect with the element being moved
 *
 * Example: If nodes A and B are horizontally aligned with 40px between them,
 * this provider creates magnets 40px to the left of A and 40px to the right of B.
